## Instructions

Use JavaScript, React, and CSS to complete the following prompt. Use of other libraries is not permitted.

## Prompt

You run a restaurant selling sandwiches and need some way of keeping track orders.
Create a React app that allows your employees to create new orders and show when they've been picked up.

1. Create a form where a user can create orders:
    - A user should be able to see each sandwich and how much they cost.
    - A user should be able to add sandwiches to the order using a button.
    - A user should not be able to add a sandwich we don't have ingredients for (see data.json).
    - A user should be able to see all items in an order.
    - A user should be able to see the total cost of the order.
    - A user should be able to complete the order using a button.

2. Create a component that display all active orders:
    - A user should be able to see all "open" orders.
    - A user should be able to uniquely identify orders from one another.
    - A user should be able to see all items in an order.
    - A user should be able to see the total cost of the order.
    - A user should be able to mark the order as "picked-up" by clicking a button.
    - A user should be able to clearly distinguish "open" and "picked-up" orders.

## Install & Run

`yarn && yarn start`

## Submission

What I would do next:

1. Write unit/`shallow` component tests

2. Break down `<PointOfSale />` into further components

3. Evolve the `styled` component library into a design system

4. If the app grew larger, would add a state management library like Redux or MobX
